<h2>History</h2>
<p>A spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the fifth to the ninth century over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced
in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. 
Thereafter, between 850 and 1280, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty.The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their 
geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the tenth century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the 
multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style.
This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshwara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the 
Chola king Rajaraja I.</p>
